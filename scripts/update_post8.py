new_content = """<p>I built my first home studio in a spare bedroom. No acoustic treatment, a webcam, the built-in laptop mic. I thought the camera was the problem. Then I bought a better camera. Still looked bad. Then I found out about lighting.</p>

<p>That was the inflection point — not the camera purchase, the lighting purchase. The understanding that shifted my image from "guy in his bedroom" to "professional production space" cost less than the camera I'd just bought and mattered ten times more.</p>

<p>Most people build a home studio backwards. They invest in camera first, discover the image still doesn't look right, then spend money trying to solve a problem they don't fully understand yet. Here's the right order and the right allocation — at three budget levels that I've actually built setups at.</p>

<h2>The Order Always Goes: Light, Sound, Camera</h2>

<p><strong>Lighting first.</strong> Nothing else influences your image as much. A well-lit shot with a $500 camera beats a beautiful camera in bad light every single time. This is not debatable — it's physics. Light is 50% of how your video looks.</p>

<p><strong>Audio second.</strong> Viewers will tolerate a slightly soft image. They will not tolerate audio that sounds like you're recording in a bathroom, or audio with 60-cycle hum, or audio that drops in and out. Bad audio is the fastest way to lose an audience. Solve it before you spend another dollar on video gear.</p>

<p><strong>Camera third.</strong> Once light and sound are handled, the camera is the last variable. Every major manufacturer at every price tier above $500 produces genuinely excellent footage when the fundamentals are in place. The camera matters least of the three.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories last.</strong> Tripod, mounts, cables, desk organization — after you have the first three working properly.</p>

<h2>Budget Level 1: $800–1,200 — Starter Professional</h2>

<p>This is the level where you stop looking like you're streaming from a laptop webcam and start looking like you take this seriously.</p>

<p><strong>Lighting ($180–220):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Amaran+Ray+120c&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amaran Ray 120c</a> with diffusion, positioned just outside your frame at roughly 45 degrees. This single change will be the biggest visual upgrade you can make to your setup. The Ray 120c is an RGBWW tube light with 96+ CRI — not a ring light, not an Amazon panel. Real color accuracy. Real soft light when positioned correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Audio ($150–200):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Rode+PodMic+USB&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rode PodMic USB</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Shure+MV7+Plus&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shure MV7+</a>. USB connection, no interface needed, sounds like a professional podcast microphone. Keep it 6–8 inches from your mouth. Your audio will be better than most of what's on YouTube.</p>

<p><strong>Camera ($350–600):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Canon+EOS+R50V&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canon R50V</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+ZV-E10+II&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony ZV-E10 II</a>. Both output clean HDMI for live streaming, shoot excellent 4K, and have enough manual control to grow into. Start with the kit lens — your lighting is doing the heavy lifting here anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories ($100):</strong> A desk mount or light stand for the Ray 120c, an HDMI capture card if you're streaming from the camera, basic cable management.</p>

<h2>Budget Level 2: $2,500–3,500 — Serious Creator</h2>

<p>At this level, the image quality becomes hard to distinguish from professional productions. The limiting factor stops being gear and becomes skill and consistency.</p>

<p><strong>Lighting ($500–700):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Amaran+120c+LED+panel&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amaran 120c panel</a> as your key light with a medium softbox, plus a small fill light or reflector. The 120c gives you full RGBWW, Bowens mount for softbox compatibility, and serious output for larger spaces. Budget for the softbox — it changes the quality of light dramatically. Add an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Amaran+F7x+LED&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amaran F7x</a> as your fill and an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Aputure+MC+Pro+RGB&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aputure MC Pro</a> as your backlight. That's a complete three-point rig.</p>

<p><strong>Audio ($400–500):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCSVYWMH?tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shure SM7B</a> with an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=SSL2+plus+audio+interface&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSL2+</a> interface. The SSL2+ has enough preamp headroom to drive the SM7B cleanly without a CloudLifter. This combination sounds like a radio studio. At this budget level, the SM7B earns its place.</p>

<p><strong>Camera ($1,200–1,800):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5GCGJG3?tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony a6700</a> with a prime lens — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+35mm+f1.8+OSS&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony 35mm f/1.8</a> is the one I'd start with. The prime lens is responsible for the separation and cinematic quality that kit lenses can't achieve. This combination produces genuinely beautiful footage when the lighting is right.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories ($300):</strong> A quality tripod or desk mount, proper XLR cables, a desktop mic arm for the SM7B, acoustic treatment panels if your room has echo. The acoustic treatment is not optional at this budget level — you've spent real money on audio gear and the room is still the variable that matters most.</p>

<h2>Budget Level 3: $6,000–10,000 — Production Studio</h2>

<p>At this level you're building a production environment that supports multiple shows, multiple cameras, and output that's indistinguishable from professional broadcast.</p>

<p><strong>Lighting ($2,000–3,000):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Aputure+300x+LED&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aputure 300X</a> as the primary key light with a large Light Dome octabox — at this level, your key light produces genuinely cinematic soft light that panels can't match. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Amaran+120c+LED&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amaran 120c panel</a> as fill. Amaran Ray tubes (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Amaran+Ray+120c&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ray 120c</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Amaran+Ray+360c&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ray 360c</a>) for background dimension and color work. At this level, lighting is designed, not just set up.</p>

<p><strong>Audio ($1,000–1,500):</strong> SM7B or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Neumann+TLM+102&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neumann TLM 102</a> for voice, routed through a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Universal+Audio+Volt+276&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Audio Volt 276</a>. The hardware compression on the Volt 276 adds the broadcast consistency that software compression can't fully replicate. Audio at this level sounds like it belongs on radio, not YouTube.</p>

<p><strong>Camera ($2,500–4,000):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JZRWRJN?tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony a7 IV</a> with a quality zoom lens — the Sony 24-70mm f/2.8 G Master if budget allows, or the 24-70mm f/4 as a solid step down. A second camera angle for interview format. Both cameras feeding clean HDMI into an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=ATEM+Mini+Pro+ISO&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ATEM Mini Pro ISO</a> for production switching. Multi-camera is the difference between a YouTube channel and a production studio.</p>

<p><strong>Infrastructure ($500–1,000):</strong> Acoustic treatment panels (minimum 4–6 panels in key reflection points), cable management, monitor calibration, and a proper backup recording workflow. If you're investing at this level, you need a recovery plan for when things fail — because they will.</p>

<h2>The One Thing That Beats All of This</h2>

<p>Consistency. The creator shipping content every week on an $800 setup beats the creator who spent $8,000 and posts once a month. Build the setup that fits your budget without creating friction, and use it every week. Upgrade one piece at a time when the gear is genuinely the limiting factor — not before.</p>

<p>Start at the level you can afford without financial stress. Build the habits. Then upgrade from a position of strength.</p>

  <p style="font-weight:700;color:#B91C1C;font-size:1.05rem;margin:0 0 0.5rem;">Start with the lights. Seriously.</p>
  <p style="color:#374151;margin:0 0 1rem;font-size:0.95rem;">The single biggest upgrade in any home studio setup is a quality key light. The Amaran Ray 120c is where I send everyone who's starting out.</p>
