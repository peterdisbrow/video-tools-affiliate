new_content = """<p>Last spring I was helping a church in Ohio build out their production setup. Solid volunteer team. Real budget. And their first question — before switcher, before cable runs, before anything — was "what camera should we get?"</p>

<p>They'd already bought one. A $2,800 mirrorless body with the kit lens. Pointed at a ring light. The stream looked like a well-lit security camera.</p>

<p>The camera was not the problem.</p>

<p>Here's what I tell everyone who asks this question first: the camera is responsible for about 20% of how your video looks. The lens is another 30%. The lighting is the other 50%. Most people have this completely backwards, and they pay for it every time they wonder why their footage doesn't look like the videos they're trying to match.</p>

<p>Get the framework right. Then pick the camera.</p>

<h2>What Are You Actually Using It For?</h2>

<p>This isn't a dodge — the answer genuinely changes the recommendation. Live streaming into a switcher has different requirements than solo YouTube content. A church running a second camera angle has different needs than a traveling creator who needs one versatile body that does everything. A studio that shoots in one location every week is a different conversation than run-and-gun documentary work.</p>

<p>Be specific. The camera that's perfect for a Blackmagic ATEM production system can be the wrong call for a solo creator editing everything themselves on a laptop.</p>

<h2>Entry-Level: Canon R50V</h2>

<p>If you're building your first real video setup and the budget needs to stay under $1,000 for the body, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Canon+EOS+R50V&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canon EOS R50V</a> is the honest starting point. Canon built this one specifically for video creators — clean HDMI output for live streaming, 4K, compact, and priced for someone who needs a camera that works without a lot of configuration. The R-mount lens ecosystem means the glass you buy now transfers to a full-frame upgrade later.</p>

<h2>For Live Streaming and Production Work</h2>

<p>If you're feeding cameras into a switcher — an ATEM, a vMix system, any live production rig — the spec that matters most is clean HDMI or SDI output. Not megapixels. Not sensor size. Clean output without UI overlays, without the crop indicator burned in, without a 30-minute auto-shutoff cutting your broadcast short.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5GCGJG3?tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony a6700</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHKL3GZL?tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony FX30</a> are both strong production cameras. Clean HDMI out, excellent video in the challenging mixed-light environments that sanctuaries and event spaces present, and they handle extended run times without thermal issues. These are reliable tools in a real production environment.</p>

<p>For professional multicam live production where full Blackmagic integration matters — talkback, tally lights, remote camera control from the switcher position — the <a href="https://atemschool.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blackmagic Studio Camera</a> is a different category entirely. It's designed from the ground up for ATEM production: all the control signals, talkback audio, and power run over a single SDI or fiber cable back to the switcher. Your camera operators know when they're on air. Your director can adjust iris and white balance on every camera from the switcher position without touching a single camera. This is how broadcast was designed to work. As a Blackmagic authorized reseller, <a href="https://atemschool.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ATEM School members get member pricing on Studio Cameras</a> — significantly better than retail.</p>

<h2>For Content Creation and YouTube</h2>

<p>The hybrid mirrorless is the right tool for most solo creators. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JZRWRJN?tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony a7 IV</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BL7X3KLV?tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canon EOS R6 Mark II</a> are the workhorses of this category — full-frame, 4K, clean HDMI out, and a lens ecosystem worth investing in. Both pull double duty if you ever want to feed them into a live production rig. Either body you put a quality prime lens on will produce footage that looks genuinely professional once the lighting is handled.</p>

<p>If full-frame is out of budget, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5GCGJG3?tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony a6700</a> is the best APS-C option right now. Same E-mount as Sony's full-frame bodies, so the glass you buy now transfers to a future upgrade without selling everything.</p>

<h2>The Budget Allocation That Actually Makes the Image Look Good</h2>

<p>If you have $2,000 to spend on a camera kit: $600–800 on the body, $700–900 on a quality prime lens — the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+35mm+f1.8+OSS&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony 35mm f/1.8</a> or Canon RF equivalent — and $300–500 on a key light.</p>

<p>A $700 body with a $700 prime lens and proper lighting will outperform a $2,000 camera with a kit lens and a ring light. Every time. The lens controls depth of field and how light renders in the image. The body is the least important variable once you're past the basic quality threshold — and every major manufacturer cleared that threshold several generations ago.</p>

<p>Put money into glass and light before you upgrade the body. That's the framework I use for every setup I build, from home studios to full production systems.</p>
