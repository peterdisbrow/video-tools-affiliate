I'd been skeptical of tube lights in general — most of the ones I'd tried were either underpowered, had terrible color rendering, or both. I'd written them off as novelty products for gaming setups and TikTok backgrounds.</p>

<p>Then I used the Ray 360c as a ceiling bounce on a church stage and completely changed my mind about what the form factor could do.</p>

<h2>What Makes the Ray Series Different</h2>

<p>The original generation of RGB LED tubes — the ones that made the format's reputation — were bad. Low-CRI diodes, washed-out color saturation, weak output, and terrible green channels. They looked great in a dark room and terrible on camera. I was right to be skeptical of them.</p>

<p>Amaran built the Ray Series on a new light engine with premium RGBWW diodes — that's red, green, blue, warm white, and cool white all in one fixture. The result is fundamentally different from first-generation RGB tubes in three specific ways:</p>

<p><strong>CRI is production-grade.</strong> The Ray series measures at 95+ CRI and 95+ TLCI — the broadcast metric. That's the same territory as dedicated white-light production fixtures. The color rendering that was the core weakness of first-generation RGB is solved here.</p>

<p><strong>Output is genuinely useful.</strong> The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Amaran+Ray+60c&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ray 60c</a> is the compact option — enough output for accent lighting, practical use, and close-range fill. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Amaran+Ray+120c&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ray 120c</a> is the workhorse of the line — enough output to function as a solo key light in a home or studio setup, not just a supporting fixture. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Amaran+Ray+360c&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ray 360c</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Amaran+Ray+660c&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ray 660c</a> bring serious output — multiple tubes can light a real stage as your primary source, not just add color accents.</p>

<p><strong>Color is tunable, not just switchable.</strong> Full RGBWW means every combination of hue and color temperature is available. Not just "red or blue or green," but the exact blend of warm and cool white to match your ambient environment, then any hue on top of that. This is the capability that changes what you can do with a lighting setup.</p>

<h2>The Full Ray Lineup</h2>

<p>Four sizes. All RGBWW. The number is the length in centimeters.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Amaran+Ray+60c&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ray 60c</a> — 60cm.</strong> The travel and accent light. Fits in almost any bag. I use this one as a practical light placed in frame, as a hair light in tight spaces, or as a background accent when I need a controlled pop of color. Compact enough that it actually gets used instead of left in the case.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Amaran+Ray+120c&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ray 120c</a> — 120cm.</strong> The workhorse. This is where most people should start with the Ray series. Enough output to be a real key light in a home studio or a meaningful fill light in a larger space. The size makes it naturally soft relative to most shooting subjects — you're getting a light source that's longer than a person is wide, which means beautiful wrap when placed correctly. This is the one I'd recommend as a first Ray purchase.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Amaran+Ray+360c&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ray 360c</a> — 360cm.</strong> Serious output. When I used this on the church stage, I rigged it horizontally above the speaking position as a top light and the coverage was excellent. Two of these across a stage provides a complete wash with color control that a panel setup would need four or five lights to match. For stage work especially, this is a compelling fixture.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Amaran+Ray+660c&tag=disbrowproduc-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ray 660c</a> — 660cm.</strong> Six and a half feet of RGBWW output. This one is for when you need serious coverage as a primary source — not an accent, not a supplement, but a real working light for large spaces. Production companies and rental houses are the primary market here.</p>

<h2>The Tube Form Factor Is Genuinely Useful</h2>

<p>I've started packing a Ray 120c into shoots where I used to bring only panels. The tube form factor solves problems panels can't — you can hang them from a rig, lean them against a wall, clamp them to a pipe, or stuff them into a space where a panel won't physically fit.</p>

<p>I've used them as hair lights hung horizontally above a subject. Bounced off a white ceiling to create a large, soft overhead source. Used sideways as edge lights with no spill on the background. Stuck vertically behind a scrim as a practical element actually visible in the shot. The versatility is real and it shows up differently on every shoot.</p>

<h2>Color Control That's Actually Useful on Set</h2>

<p>Here's the thing about RGB that changed my thinking: it's not about making your background purple. It's about having complete color control over the relationship between every light in your setup.</p>

<p>On a typical shoot, I'm matching color temperatures between sources — windows, practicals, my main fixtures — and trying to create intentional color separation between subject and background. With a fixed white-light panel, I can control intensity and color temp. With an RGBWW tube, I can dial in the exact hue, shift the white balance point slightly to push warmth or coolness, and create the color relationship I want between every element of the setup. That's not a party trick. That's what professional colorists have been asking for from their lighting departments for years.</p>

<p>The Amaran Creator app handles all of this from your phone — Bluetooth control, color selection, multi-light sync, built-in effects. It's genuinely well-made and much more capable than you'd expect at this price point.</p>

<h2>Who the Ray Series Is For</h2>

<p>Home studios where you want a versatile lighting tool that works as key, fill, hair light, and background element depending on the shoot. Stage setups where color control over the wash makes a real difference in how the production looks on camera. Location shoots where you need a compact light that punches above its size. Photographers and videographers building a kit that's useful across a wider range of scenarios than a panel-only setup.</p>

<p>If you're building a lighting kit from scratch and you've been looking at panels exclusively, add at least one Ray 120c to your list. The form factor will surprise you with how much it gets used.</p>
