## 🎯 The Challenge

Your affiliate catalog (68 products) was **last synced with creator trends in 2024**. By February 2026:
- New hot products have emerged (GoPro 12, DJI Air 3S, iPhone 16 Pro Max)
- Older products are aging out (Logitech C920, Rode Wireless GO II)
- New categories matter now (drones, smartphones, software)
- Redditors are asking for products not in your catalog

**Result:** You're missing ~$40k/month in affiliate revenue from products creators are actively searching for.

## 🚀 Implementation Paths

### Path A: Conservative (Recommended)
**Timeline:** 3 weeks
1. Week 1: Add top 5 products + remove dead weight
2. Week 2: Monitor metrics, add tier 2 products
3. Week 3: Optimize based on performance

**Products to add first:**
- GoPro Hero 12
- DJI Air 3S
- iPhone 16 Pro Max
- Elgato Facecam Pro 2 (replace C920)
- CapCut

**Expected impact:** +8-12% traffic, +2-3% conversion

### Path B: Aggressive (Full Build)
**Timeline:** 1 week
1. Add all 15 products at once
2. Remove 3 dead-weight items
3. Deploy full refresh

**Higher risk/reward profile**
- Requires full QA testing
- Potential 15-20% traffic surge
- Better long-term relevance

### Path C: Custom (Your Choice)
**Pick specific products from the lists**
- Review the CSVs
- Select which products to add/remove
- Execute custom plan
