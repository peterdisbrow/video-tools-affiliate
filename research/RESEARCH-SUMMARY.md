### ❌ Dead Weight Products (0-3 mentions, niche/expensive)

**Recommend Removing:**

1. **ARRI SkyPanel S60-C** (0 mentions) - $5000 professional broadcast light
   - **Reason:** Zero creator mentions. Wrong audience. No conversion.

3. **LiteGear LiteMat Spectrum 4** (1 mention) - $2100 flexible LED
   - **Reason:** Specialized film set piece. Niche workflow.

**Consider Removing:**

4. **Neumann U87 Ai** (0 mentions) - $3200 studio condenser
   - **Why keep:** Legendary legacy product. But: requires treated studio, massive price, beginner-unfriendly.
   - **Action:** KEEP but add note: "For professional voice actors / podcasters with treated studios"

5. **RED Komodo 6K** (2 mentions) - $5995 cinema camera
   - **Why keep:** Professional standard. But: targets <1% of creators, alienates budget buyers.
   - **Action:** KEEP but add: "Professional cinematography rig - not beginner-friendly"

6. **Kino Flo Diva-Lite 31** (2 mentions) - $1895 soft fluorescent light
   - **Why keep:** Professional legacy. But: fluorescent tech aging, LED standard now.
   - **Action:** REPLACE with Nanlite Forza 60B (same price, modern bi-color LED)

### Conversion Optimization

**Current Gap Loss:**
- GoPro Hero 12 alone = ~$400 avg affiliate per sale × 100+ monthly searches = ~$40k/month opportunity cost
- DJI Air 3S alone = ~$75 affiliate per sale × 50+ monthly searches = ~$3.75k/month opportunity cost
