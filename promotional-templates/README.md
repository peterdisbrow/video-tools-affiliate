Title: Just created a free gear checklist for new YouTube creators — no BS buying guide

I spent weeks going through Reddit threads, manufacturer specs, and creator reviews to build
a gear buying checklist for new YouTube creators.

It covers:
- 📋 Interactive checklist with 4 budget tiers ($0-$5K+)
- 💰 Budget planner (select gear, see the total)
- 🚀 30-day action plan from zero to first upload

The biggest takeaway from my research: audio matters WAY more than camera. A $20 lav mic +
iPhone beats a $2K camera with built-in audio. Every time.

No email required to view the guides. If you want updates when gear changes, there's an
optional signup.

Happy to answer any gear questions in the comments!

Title: I broke down YouTube setups at 4 price points ($65, $209, $2.2K, $3.3K) — here's what actually matters

After analyzing 40+ Reddit threads about creator gear, I found clear patterns in what
experienced creators recommend vs what beginners think they need.

The $65 setup (seriously):
- Smartphone camera ($0)
- Boya BY-M1 lav mic ($20)
- Ring light ($30)
- Phone tripod mount ($15)
- DaVinci Resolve (free)

Full breakdown with all 4 tiers: [link to /free-gear-guide]

The #1 thing every experienced creator says: START. Don't wait for perfect gear.

### Template 3: Specific advice response
**Use when:** Someone asks "what camera/mic should I buy?" in a thread

```
Great question! The answer really depends on your budget and content type.

Quick version:
- Under $500: Use your phone + get a $20-100 mic. Seriously.
- $500-1K: Sony ZV-1F ($398) + Audio-Technica AT2020 ($99)
- $1-2K: Sony a6700 ($1,398) + Rode Wireless GO II ($299)

I put together a free interactive gear checklist that covers all budget tiers

The one universal truth: get audio right first. Viewers forgive bad video,
never bad audio.

### Twitter/X

I analyzed 40+ Reddit threads to find out what gear YouTube creators actually recommend (when there's no sponsorship money involved).

The results surprised me. Thread 🧵

1/ Camera: Sony ZV-1F dominates every "what should I buy" thread
2/ Audio: Rode Wireless GO II — the undisputed Reddit champion
3/ Lighting: Neewer panels. Nobody recommends expensive lights for beginners.
4/ Software: DaVinci Resolve. "Why would you pay for Premiere?" is the common response.

The $65 YouTube setup that beats 90% of beginners 📷

Phone camera ($0) + clip-on mic ($20) + ring light ($30) + phone mount ($15) + DaVinci Resolve (free) = better than most people's $2K setups

Why? Audio > Camera. Every. Single. Time.
