Aputure lights (98+ TLCI) offer clinical precision where skin tones are perfect. For most creators? Amaran is 90% of the way there at 1/4 the price.</p>\n<h2>My Honest Take</h2>\n<p><strong>If you're a creator:</strong> Start with Amaran. The P80c is my go-to travel light. You get professional results at creator prices.</p>\n<p><strong>If you're doing paid work:</strong> Invest in Aputure. Your clients are paying enough that you can afford higher-end gear. The CRI difference justifies the cost when you're charging $5k+ per project.</p>\n<p><strong>If you're unsure:</strong> Buy one Amaran P80c ($350). See how you use it. Most creators stay happy with Amaran. If you outgrow it, upgrade to Aputure later.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;margin:2rem 0;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Amaran+LED+lights\" style=\"display:inline-block;padding:12px 24px;background:#FF6B35;color:white;text-decoration:none;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold;\">Browse Amaran Lights on Amazon</a></p>\n<p style=\"font-size:0.9rem;color:#666;\"><em>This is an affiliate link.
