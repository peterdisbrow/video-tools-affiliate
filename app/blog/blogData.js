    content: `<h2>Why Lighting Matters</h2>
<p>Professional video starts with professional lighting. Even a smartphone camera with great lighting will outproduce an expensive cinema camera in a dark room.</p>
<h2>Three-Point Lighting Setup</h2>
<p>The foundation of professional video lighting: key light, fill light, and back light.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Light:</strong> Main light source, positioned 45° from camera. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BCVG1VW?tag=disbrowproduc-20">Godox SL60W</a> is a reliable workhorse for key lighting.</li>
<li><strong>Fill Light:</strong> Reduces shadows, positioned opposite key light at lower intensity</li>
<li><strong>Back Light:</strong> Separates subject from background, creates depth</li>
</ul>
<h2>Budget-Friendly Options</h2>
<p>Start with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0869H68M6?tag=disbrowproduc-20">Neewer LED Panel</a> ($45). Add soft boxes like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4XVKPVN?tag=disbrowproduc-20">Aputure Light Dome III</a> and reflectors as you grow.</p>
<h2>Mid-Range Upgrade</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RNW1HL6?tag=disbrowproduc-20">Aputure Amaran 200d</a> ($289) is a professional-grade LED with Bowens mount compatibility for serious studio setups.</p>
<h2>Color Temperature</h2>
<p>Match your lights to daylight (5600K) or tungsten (3200K). Mismatched color temps look unprofessional. Use gels to balance. Bi-color LEDs like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BN2K4PWS?tag=disbrowproduc-20">Nanlite Forza 300B</a> give you full control over color temperature.</p>`

    content: `<h2>Why Audio Matters More Than Video</h2>
<p>Viewers will forgive mediocre video quality if your audio is excellent. But they'll abandon your content immediately if the audio is bad.</p>
<h2>Essential Microphones</h2>
<p>Invest in a quality microphone first. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084P1CXFD?tag=disbrowproduc-20">Rode NT-USB+</a> ($169) is plug-and-play USB condenser perfection.</p>
<p>For dynamic applications, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCSVYWMH?tag=disbrowproduc-20">Shure SM7B</a> ($399) is the industry standard that rejects ambient noise beautifully.</p>
<p>On a tighter budget, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006H92QK?tag=disbrowproduc-20">Audio-Technica AT2020</a> ($99) delivers unbeatable quality for the price.</p>
<h2>Audio Interface</h2>
<p>Pair your XLR mic with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5JRWFP7?tag=disbrowproduc-20">Focusrite Scarlett 2i2</a> ($179) — the world's best-selling audio interface for creators.</p>
<h2>Acoustic Basics</h2>
<p>Soft materials absorb sound. Use curtains, bookshelves, and carpets to control reflections. Recording in a closet surrounded by clothes is a pro tip.</p>
<h2>Post-Processing</h2>
<p>Use noise gates and gentle EQ to clean up your recordings. Most audio issues are fixed in post, not in capture.</p>`

    content: `<h2>Why Green Screen?</h2>
<p>Green screens let you remove your background and replace it with anything. Tutorials, presentations, cinematic backgrounds—infinite possibilities.</p>
<h2>DIY Green Screen Backdrop ($20-50)</h2>
<p>Buy a green fabric backdrop from Amazon ($20-30). Mount it on a stand or hang it from a ceiling mount. Make sure it's evenly lit to avoid shadows and color variations.</p>
<h2>Lighting for Chroma Keying</h2>
<p>Even, shadow-free lighting is critical. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0869H68M6?tag=disbrowproduc-20">Neewer LED Panel</a> is perfect for evenly lighting your green screen on a budget. You need:</p>
<ul>
<li>2-3 lights on the green screen (the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BCVG1VW?tag=disbrowproduc-20">Godox SL60W</a> is excellent for this)</li>
<li>Separate key light and fill light on yourself</li>
<li>At least 6 feet distance between you and the screen (eliminates green spill)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Camera Settings</h2>
<p>Shoot at 1080p or higher with a camera like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5GCGJG3?tag=disbrowproduc-20">Sony a6700</a>. Use manual white balance to match your lighting color temp.</p>

<p>Shaky footage looks amateur. Smooth movement looks professional. Invest in stabilization to elevate your production quality immediately.</p>
<h2>Gimbal Stabilizers</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CS6LC1ZQ?tag=disbrowproduc-20">DJI RS 3</a> ($449) smooths out handheld movement with 3-axis stabilization and a touchscreen.

<h2>Handheld Stabilization Techniques</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep your elbows against your body for stability</li>
<li>Move slowly—quick jerky movements show instability</li>
<li>Use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G4NLPCKF?tag=disbrowproduc-20">Peak Design Travel Tripod</a> or monopod for static shots, then pan or tilt smoothly</li>
<li>Record 60fps and slow to 24fps for artificial stabilization</li>
</ul>
<h2>Combination Approach</h2>
<p>Use a gimbal for walk-and-talk shots, slider for transitions, and locked tripod for interviews. Mix stabilization styles for visual interest.</p>`
