    content: `<h2>Why Lighting Matters</h2>
<p>Professional video starts with professional lighting. Even a smartphone camera with great lighting will outproduce an expensive cinema camera in a dark room.</p>
<h2>Three-Point Lighting Setup</h2>
<p>The foundation of professional video lighting: key light, fill light, and back light.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Light:</strong> Main light source, positioned 45° from camera</li>
<li><strong>Fill Light:</strong> Reduces shadows, positioned opposite key light at lower intensity</li>
<li><strong>Back Light:</strong> Separates subject from background, creates depth</li>
</ul>
<h2>Budget-Friendly Options</h2>
<p>Start with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q7G7JGP?tag=disbrowproduc-20">Neewer LED Panel</a> ($80-150). Add soft boxes and reflectors as you grow.</p>
<h2>Color Temperature</h2>
<p>Match your lights to daylight (5600K) or tungsten (3200K). Mismatched color temps look unprofessional. Use gels to balance.</p>`

    content: `<h2>Why Audio Matters More Than Video</h2>
<p>Viewers will forgive mediocre video quality if your audio is excellent. But they'll abandon your content immediately if the audio is bad.</p>
<h2>Essential Microphones</h2>
<p>Invest in a quality microphone first. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09P7X1X39?tag=disbrowproduc-20">Rode NT-USB+</a> ($99) is plug-and-play USB condenser perfection.</p>
<p>For dynamic applications, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002E4Z8M?tag=disbrowproduc-20">Shure SM7B</a> ($399) is the industry standard that rejects ambient noise beautifully.</p>
<h2>Acoustic Basics</h2>
<p>Soft materials absorb sound. Use curtains, bookshelves, and carpets to control reflections. Recording in a closet surrounded by clothes is a pro tip.</p>
<h2>Post-Processing</h2>
<p>Use noise gates and gentle EQ to clean up your recordings. Most audio issues are fixed in post, not in capture.</p>`

    content: `<h2>Why Green Screen?</h2>
<p>Green screens let you remove your background and replace it with anything. Tutorials, presentations, cinematic backgrounds—infinite possibilities.</p>
<h2>DIY Green Screen Backdrop ($20-50)</h2>
<p>Buy a green fabric backdrop from Amazon ($20-30). Mount it on a stand or hang it from a ceiling mount. Make sure it's evenly lit to avoid shadows and color variations.</p>
<h2>Lighting for Chroma Keying</h2>
<p>Even, shadow-free lighting is critical. You need:</p>
<ul>
<li>2-3 lights on the green screen (backlight it, don't let it be dark)</li>
<li>Separate key light and fill light on yourself</li>
<li>At least 6 feet distance between you and the screen (eliminates green spill)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Camera Settings</h2>
<p>Shoot at 1080p or higher. Use manual white balance to match your lighting color temp. In post, use software like Photoshop, Premiere, or DaVinci Resolve to key out the green.</p>
<h2>Keying Software</h2>
<p>Most editing software has built-in chroma key tools. Premiere Pro and DaVinci have excellent keyers. For streaming, OBS has a chroma key filter.</p>`

    content: `<h2>Why Stabilization Matters</h2>
<p>Shaky footage looks amateur. Smooth movement looks professional. Invest in stabilization to elevate your production quality immediately.</p>
<h2>Gimbal Stabilizers</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C6XMPZ23?tag=disbrowproduc-20">DJI gimbal</a> smooths out handheld movement electronically. The Osmo Pocket series ($749) is built-in stabilization. For larger cameras, gimbals run $1000-5000.</p>
<h2>Manual Slider & Dolly</h2>
<p>A simple slider creates professional parallax movement. Build one for $50 with PVC pipe and a camera slider. More expensive rigs start at $300.</p>
<h2>Handheld Stabilization Techniques</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep your elbows against your body for stability</li>
<li>Move slowly—quick jerky movements show instability</li>
<li>Use tripod/monopod for static shots, then pan or tilt smoothly</li>
<li>Record 60fps and slow to 24fps for artificial stabilization</li>
</ul>
<h2>Combination Approach</h2>
<p>Use a gimbal for walk-and-talk shots, slider for transitions, and locked tripod for interviews. Mix stabilization styles for visual interest.</p>`
