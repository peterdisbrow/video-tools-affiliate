Hey {{FNAME}},

I spent weeks going through Reddit — r/youtube, r/NewTubers, r/videography, r/Filmmakers — reading what real creators recommend to each other when there's no sponsorship money involved.

**Here's what actually gets recommended (not sponsored):**

📷 **Camera:** Sony ZV-1F and Sony a6700 dominate every "what should I buy" thread. Canon gets love too, but Sony's autofocus wins people over.

🎙️ **Audio:** Rode Wireless GO II is the #1 most recommended mic on Reddit for YouTube. Period. The Shure SM7B is the podcaster's choice.

💡 **Lighting:** Neewer panels and Godox SL60W. Nobody on Reddit recommends expensive lighting for beginners.

🖥️ **Software:** DaVinci Resolve. It's not even close. "Why would you pay for Premiere?" is a common response.

**The surprising part?** Most experienced creators tell beginners to start with their phone + a $20-100 mic setup. The camera upgrade comes later.

**Most trending right now (Feb 2026):**
- Sony ZV-1F — best value vlogging camera
- Rode Wireless GO II — wireless mic king
- Neewer LED panels — budget lighting champion
- DaVinci Resolve — free editing that rivals $300+ software
