**Subject:** The #1 Mistake New Creators Make With Gear
**Preview:** It's not buying cheap. It's buying in the wrong order.

Hey {{FNAME}},

The biggest mistake I see new creators make?

**Buying a $2,000 camera before getting a $99 microphone.**

Here's the truth: viewers will watch grainy footage with great audio. They will NOT watch beautiful 4K footage with echo-y, muffled sound.

The right buying order:

1. **Audio first** ($20-$299) — Even a $20 lav mic transforms your content
2. **Lighting second** ($30-$130) — Two LED panels beat any camera upgrade
3. **Camera third** — Your phone is fine until steps 1 and 2 are solid
4. **Software** — DaVinci Resolve is free. Literally Hollywood-grade. Free.

I've seen creators with $5K setups get fewer views than someone with an iPhone, a $20 mic, and a window for lighting.

**The real flex isn't expensive gear — it's knowing what actually matters.**
