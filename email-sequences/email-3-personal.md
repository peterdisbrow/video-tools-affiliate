Hey {{FNAME}},

Quick honest confession:

When I started, I bought a full-frame camera before I had proper audio or lighting. $800+ on a camera body when a $398 Sony ZV-1F would have been perfect for what I was doing.

I'm not the only one. Here's what I learned from analyzing 40+ Reddit threads about creator gear:

**What creators ACTUALLY regret:**
- Buying a camera that's "overkill" for their content type
- Ignoring audio ("I wish someone told me to get a mic first")
- Overspending on lighting when $45 Neewer panels work great
- Paying for Premiere Pro when DaVinci Resolve is free

**What creators NEVER regret:**
- Getting a wireless mic system (Rode Wireless GO II comes up constantly)
- Investing in good lighting early
- Starting with their phone + good audio
- Buying a tripod (even a cheap one)

The pattern is clear: **the creators who grow fastest spend smart, not big.**
